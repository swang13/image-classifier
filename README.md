## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is the second project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one iPython notebook to showcase work related to this project. 
predict.py contains code that can be called by a command line application to run prediction on a new image. 
train.py includes codes to train the classifier that can be called by a command line application.
cat_to_name.json is provided by Udacity to load in a mapping from category label to category name.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The image classifier trained through tranfer learning was able to reach 94% accuracy on the test data.
